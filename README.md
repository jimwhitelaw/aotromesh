This fork of [Meshtastic](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware) is meant to be a minimal mesh networking system to provide a platform for developing other mesh-enabled applications. It's possible to enable all Meshtastic features, but in that case, you're probably better off using MT itself. This fork by default disables GPS, Bluetooth/phone, WiFi, Screen, Buttons, MQTT, Telemetry and most Modules. This is very much a work-in-progress and still needs much refinement.
